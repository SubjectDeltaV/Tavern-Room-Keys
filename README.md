# Tavern Room Keys
 Tavern Room Keys mod for SSE

OVERVIEW
A simple mod that adds room keys (2 in fact) for when you check in and out of taverns. There are also a number of changes to Inkkeeper behavior to make it more immersive. (Inkeepers actually sleep for once). Requires Lockable Locks Mod. 

DESCRIPTION
This is a simple addition to something that you may not have noticed was missing from your tavern experience: Room Keys.

CHANGES INCLUDED:
-Room Keys Have Been Added to the four Major Inns (Silver-Blood, Bannered Mare, Winking Skeever, Bee and Barb, Candlehearth Hall)
-Innkeepers and servers now juggle there hours throughout the day (hours vary), they will go to sleep and take breaks throughout the day
-Inns will now lock there doors at night (Compatability with Simply Knock is planned)
-A note has been placed on each Inn desk detailing the hours
-Each Inn Room now has a safe, compatible with your room key, also includes a brief welcome note from the inkeeper [This safe will only be safe storage for the duration of your stay, it will reset during cell reset!]
-NOTE: Lockable locks is marked as a requirement, while there is no technical reliance on this script, the usability of this mod is nullified without it

HOW IT WORKS:
-Check-in to the Inn room as you normally would
-On Check-in, the innkeeper will give you 2 keys: 1 for your room and 1 for the building for after hours
-When your room expires both keys will be removed, be sure to have all your belongings out before then!
